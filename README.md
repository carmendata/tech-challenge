Technical challenge for prospective developers

Fork the repo (Github or Bitbucket) and download it. Open the `index.html` in a browser window (this doesn't need to be via a web server you can just drag and drop it).

Follow the instructions laid out in the html page, editing the files as you see fit.

## Tasks

Prefix your commit messages with the task you're working on at the time, e.g. "Task One: fixed removed incorrect closing </p> tag"

If your commit isn't about a task... you don't need to prefix it (but still write a good message)

## On completion

Once you're done and your code is committed share the completed repo back with us.

You can email us a link to your public repo or add collaborators to your private repo.

Technical challenge for prospective developers

Fork the repo and download it. Open the `index.html` in a browser window (this doesn't need to be via a web server you can just drag and drop it).

Follow the instructions laid out in the html page, editing the files as you see fit.

Once you're done and your code is committed share the completed repo back with us.
